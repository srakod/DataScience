    "###### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For many shoppers, visiting shopping malls is a great way to relax and enjoy themselves during weekends and holidays. They can do grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, shop at the various fashion outlets, watch movies and perform many more activities. Shopping malls are like a one-stop destination for all types of shoppers. For retailers, the central location and the large crowd at the shopping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. Property developers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the demand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Mumbai and many more are being built. Opening shopping malls allows property developers to earn consistent rental income. Of course, as with any business decision, opening a new shopping mall requires serious consideration and is a lot more complicated than it seems. Particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure."

    "To solve the problem, we will need the following data:\n",
    "• List of neighbourhoods in Mumbai. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Mumbai, the financial capital city of the country of India.\n",
    "• Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighbourhoods. This is required in order to\n",

    "This Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_of_Mumbai) contains a list of neighbourhoods in Mumbai, with a total of 42 neighbourhoods. We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautifulsoup packages. Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods using\n",
    "Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods.After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods.Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working withAPI (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium).\n"
